Salutations and what is up? üòÅ My name's Colin or 
Spectrum, you can call me whatever you want. 
I'm 13 years old, started programming when I was 
10 or 11. I'm currently an intermediate in C++, C
Java, JS, C# and Python. I'm a beginner in
Kotlin, Swift, Lua, Ruby and Go. I'm also very into other science fields 
like physics, computer science, more... I'm working on a compiled programming language
at the moment. It's called Cubic. Looking forward to learn
how to make an operating system. Programming is a fun thing to do
during the pandemic ‚ù§Ô∏è The reason why programming is really fun is that
You give your computer a set of instructions and it'll do them and nothing more.

NOTE: If you'd like to learn more about Cubic, please reach me and I'll answer your questions.
There are several ways to reach me:
