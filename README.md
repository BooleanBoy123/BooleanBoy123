Salutations and what is up? 😁 My name's Colin or 
Spectrum, you can call me whatever you want. 
I'm 13 years old, started programming when I was 
10 or 11. I'm currently an intermediate in C++, C
Java, JS, C# and Python. I'm a beginner in
Kotlin, Swift, Lua, Ruby and Go. I'm working on a programming language
at the moment. It's called Cubic. Looking forward to learn
how to make an operating system. Programming is a fun thing to do
during the pandemic ❤️
